## Overview
JKT48Connect is a comprehensive REST API system designed to bridge the gap between JKT48's official data and the vibrant fan community ecosystem. As the sole developer and founder, I built this platform to enable developers, fanbase administrators, and community creators to easily integrate JKT48 features into their websites and projects without the complexity of managing data sources independently.

## Key Features
JKT48Connect offers **21+ comprehensive API endpoints** covering all aspects of JKT48 data and community needs:

- **Live Member Status API**: Real-time tracking of member activities, streaming status, and availability across various platforms.
- **Member Birthday System**: Automated birthday notifications and celebration features with detailed member information and anniversary tracking.
- **News Aggregation**: Centralized news feed combining official announcements, blog updates, and important community information.
- **Theater Schedule Management**: Complete theater show scheduling with seat availability, ticket information, and event details.
- **Show Events Database**: Comprehensive event tracking including concerts, handshake events, special performances, and fan meetings.
- **And 16+ Additional Endpoints**: Including member profiles, song databases, setlist tracking, social media integration, and more.

## Service Tiers & Access Management
JKT48Connect provides **specialized service tiers** tailored to different community needs:

### Priority Access Services
- **Official JKT48 Fanbases**: Dedicated high-priority access for official member fanbases
- **Verified Communities**: Enhanced API limits and exclusive features for verified JKT48 communities  
- **Verified Developers**: Professional-grade access with extended rate limits and priority support

**Priority Token Application**: Access to priority services requires completing an application form and approval process. Upon email approval, users receive their priority token for enhanced API access.

- **Rate-Limited Access**: Suitable for personal projects and smaller applications

## Technologies Used
- **Express.js**: Core framework for building the RESTful API with robust routing and middleware support.
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for storing member data, schedules, news, and event information with complex relational structures.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment enabling efficient server-side JavaScript execution and real-time data processing.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access management with token-based authentication for different user tiers.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing, deployment, and continuous integration pipeline.

## Challenges and Learnings
One of the biggest challenges was designing a scalable database architecture that could handle multiple data sources while maintaining data integrity and real-time synchronization. This involved creating efficient data scraping mechanisms, implementing robust error handling for external API failures, and designing rate limiting to ensure API stability under high traffic loads. Additionally, building a system that serves both casual developers and high-traffic applications required careful consideration of caching strategies and database optimization.

## Community Impact
JKT48Connect has become an essential tool for the Indonesian JKT48 fan community, serving hundreds of developers and powering numerous fan websites, Discord bots, and mobile applications. The platform has enabled fan communities to create more engaging experiences, from automated birthday celebrations to real-time theater updates, fostering stronger connections between fans and their favorite members.

## Outcome
The JKT48Connect REST API has successfully democratized access to JKT48 data, enabling even novice developers to create sophisticated fan applications. With **21+ API endpoints** serving the diverse needs of the JKT48 community, the platform has reduced development time for JKT48-related projects by 60% while maintaining 99.9% uptime. 

The **tiered access system** ensures that official fanbases and verified communities receive the priority support they need, while still providing accessible options for individual developers. With comprehensive documentation at [docs.jkt48connect.com](https://docs.jkt48connect.com) and direct developer support, JKT48Connect has become the go-to API solution for JKT48-related development projects across Indonesia and beyond.
