## The Beginning
My journey into the world of programming wasn't conventional. Like many self-taught developers, I didn't start with a computer science degree or a clear roadmap. Instead, it began with curiosity and a simple question: "How do websites actually work?"

## Finding My Passion
What started as casual interest quickly evolved into something deeper when I discovered the vibrant JKT48 fan community. As someone who appreciated both technology and the idol culture, I noticed a gap - fans and developers needed better tools to access JKT48 data for their projects. This observation would later become the foundation of everything I built.

## The Learning Phase
Teaching myself programming was challenging but rewarding. I spent countless hours learning:
- **JavaScript fundamentals** through online tutorials and documentation
- **Node.js and Express.js** by building small practice projects
- **Database design** with PostgreSQL, making many mistakes along the way
- **API development** by creating endpoints and learning about REST principles
- **Frontend technologies** including React and Next.js for complete full-stack capabilities

Each concept built upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation that would prove invaluable later.

## Birth of JKT48Connect
In 2023, I decided to turn my learning into something meaningful for the community. JKT48Connect started as a simple idea: create a comprehensive REST API that would make JKT48 data easily accessible to developers and fan communities.

What began as a few basic endpoints grew into a platform with **21+ API features**, including:
- Live member status tracking
- Birthday notification systems
- News aggregation
- Theater scheduling
- Event management
- And much more

## Building Community Bridges
One of the most rewarding aspects of creating JKT48Connect has been seeing how it bridges different communities:
- **Official fanbases** using priority access for enhanced features
- **Individual developers** creating personal projects with standard API keys
- **Verified communities** building sophisticated applications
- **New developers** learning API integration through comprehensive documentation

## Current Adventures
Today, I continue to maintain and expand JKT48Connect while also taking on new challenges. Working as an IT Admin at Nayrakuen has provided valuable experience in backend infrastructure and system optimization, skills that directly benefit the JKT48Connect platform.

I've also developed complementary tools like:
- **Discord bots** for real-time JKT48 updates
- **WhatsApp integration** for community notifications
- **Comprehensive documentation** at docs.jkt48connect.com
- **React-based showcase website** for data visualization

## Lessons Learned
This journey has taught me several valuable lessons:
- **Community-driven development** creates the most meaningful projects
- **Documentation is as important** as the code itself
- **Listening to users** leads to better product decisions
- **Consistency and reliability** build trust in the developer community
- **Never stop learning** - technology evolves rapidly

## Looking Forward
The future holds exciting possibilities. With hundreds of developers now using JKT48Connect daily, I'm focused on:
- Expanding API capabilities based on community feedback
- Improving performance and scalability
- Building better developer tools and resources
- Fostering an even stronger JKT48 development community

## A Message to Aspiring Developers
If you're just starting your programming journey, remember that every expert was once a beginner. Find a problem you're passionate about solving, start small, and don't be afraid to share your work with others. The developer community is incredibly supportive, and your unique perspective might be exactly what someone else needs.

Whether you're interested in contributing to JKT48Connect, building your own projects, or just learning to code, remember that the journey is just as valuable as the destination.
